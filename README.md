Made my wife an inside joke website. It randomly generates an inside joke between us. She can go to the website when she needs a chuckle to herself. 

I'm learning basics of web development, so I wanted some simple HTML, CSS, and JS practice. The HTML contains a single div container which holds the text with a border. 

The CSS in this first version is a simple border with padding. My next iteration is to make a glow/neon border with a shadow for effect.

The JS iterates through a txt file that I maintain (whenever I catch us using an inside joke, I add another to the list). It selects a random line from the file and prints it on the page.
